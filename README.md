# ConservativeSelfForce

This project aims to calculate the Conservative Electromagnetic Self-force for eccentric orbits in Kerr Geometry.

## Directories
- Tex Contians a Tex Doccument with all the notes made on the calculation
- Notebooks Contains all the Mathematica notebooks written in the calculatin

## Notebooks
- **SchwarzchildEccentricSelfForce.nb**: Calculates the self force at a point in the orbit for a particle in an eccentric orbit about a schwarzchild black hole
- **KerrCircularSelfForce.nb**: Calculates the self force at a point in the orbit for a particle in circular orbit about a Kerr Black Hole
- **SchwarzchildCircularSelfForce.nb**: Calculates the self force at apoint in the orbit for a particle
